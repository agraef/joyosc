rc-unitd: the robotcowboy unit daemon

a device event to osc bridge deamon and associated tools

Dan Wilcox <danomatika@robotcowboy.com>

##### DESCRIPTION #####

The rc-unitd package contains the following parts:
1. rc-unitd - device event daemon
2. rc-unit-notifier - insert/removal notification tool
3. lsjs - joystick info tool

This group of tools allows any osc-capable program to receive joystick event data aka button presses, axis movements, etc.  Specific joysticks can be mapped by name to specific osc send addresses.  A notification tool can control the runing daemon.

A udev rules set is provided for GNU/Linux to enable automatic notificaiton when devices are plugged in.

These tools were originally developed for the robotcowboy project, a wearable computer
music system using Pure Data in GNU/Linux. See http://robotcowboy.com.

##### BUILD REQUIREMENTS #####

The following libraries are required:
	- SDL
	- liblo (lightweight osc)

On Max OS X, they can be installed using macports: http://macports.org
    - install the macport binary and setup the macports environment
    - go to the Terminal and install the libs:
        sudo port install libsdl liblo

##### BUILD AND INSTALLATION #####
 
./configure
make
sudo make install

This readme, example config files, and the pd library are also installed to your doc dir, something like $(prefix)/share/doc/rc-unitd.

##### USAGE #####

All applications have a full help usage printout, use -h or --help.

% rc-unitd config_file.xml

Starts device daemon using the given config file.  The config file sets the osc connection information as well as device to osc address mappings. Look at the example_config.xml file installed to the doc folder for details.

See the pd patches in the pd folder on how to communicate with rc-unitd.

----

% lsjs

The lsjs tool lists the names of currently plugged in joysticks, which you can then use to create your device mappings.

----

% rc-unit-notifier 

Used to control a running rc-unitd.  Can be used to signal device add or removals as well as send a quit command.

There is a udev rule file for Linux installed to the doc dir that can be used to automatically call rc-unit-notifier when a joystick device is plugged/unplugged.

##### DEVELOPING #####

A Premake4 script and IDE files can be found in the prj folder.  Premake4 can generate the IDE files from a given lua script.  Download Premake4 from http://industriousone.com/premake.

Make sure the externals are built using make in the externals dir.

You can enable a debug build using ./configure --enable-debug.

I develop using an IDE, then update the autotools files when the sources are finished.  I run make dist-check to make sure the distributable package can be built successfully.

##### FUTURE IDEAS/IMPROVEMENTS #####

Ok, lots of ideas to pursue ...

 - re-add wiimote support using a cross platform library
 - multiple osc send addresses for event forwarding between multiple machines
 - make a systray applet for gui control of rc-unitd ala qtjackctl->jackd
 - add built in osc -> MIDI and other mapping capability (ala junXion or Osculator)
