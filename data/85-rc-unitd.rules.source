#	Put me in "/etc/udev/rules.d", I am named based on the debian udev rules format
#
#	launches rc-unit-notifier to send OSC notification of device insert/removal to rc-unitd
#	- rc-unitd is the device handling daemon the reads events for open devices
#	- rc-unit-notifier tells rc-unitd to open or close a device by kernel name
#
#	"add" actions are device insertions and device attributes are used to match the device
#
#	"remove" actions are matched using ENV variables since the SYSFS node for the device is gone
#	and thus the attributes have been deleted
#
#	rules built using:
#	- udevinfo -a -p $(udevinfo -q path -n /dev/*device*) : attributes
#	- sudo udevmonitor --env /dev/*device* : events and env vars
